# Theme Resources for DU #

This repo's main purpose is to provide an up-to-date zip/repo to make themer's job a bit easier.

Their success is our success. If we're not doing our part to help them, why should they help us?

This repo will be updated at least once a week.

For now it will be done manually by me, Alex Cruz but I will go ahead and throw a script together 
tomorrow for all to use if you decide to fork this repo and make the necessary changes depending on 
your project :-)

Pull requests are welcomed but we much rather you submit anything you may have to help to our gerrit
